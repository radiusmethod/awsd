It is possible to short cut the menu selection by passing
the profile name you want to switch to as an argument.

```sh
> awsd work
Profile work set.
```

## Show your AWS Profile in your shell prompt
For better visibility into what your shell is set to it can be helpful to configure your prompt to show the value of the env variable `AWS_PROFILE`.

Here's a sample of my zsh prompt config using oh-my-zsh themes

```sh
# AWS info
local aws_info='$(aws_prof)'
function aws_prof {
  local profile="${AWS_PROFILE:=}"
  echo -n "%{$fg_bold[blue]%}aws:(%{$fg[cyan]%}${profile}%{$fg_bold[blue]%})%{$reset_color%} "
}
```

```sh
PROMPT='OTHER_PROMPT_STUFF $(aws_info)'
```
